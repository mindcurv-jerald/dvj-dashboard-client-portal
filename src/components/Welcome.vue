        <p><strong>Secure | Custom Branding | Easy</strong></p>
        <p>Power BI is a power dashboarding tool by Microsoft for data visualization. With Power BI, you can quickly create useful reports and dashboards. Sharing this with your clients however, can be a little bit more tedious. In order to privately share dashboards, you would have to create a Power BI Pro account for every customer.</p>
        <p>But not every customer wants this, or wants to know about power BI. Most customers are only interested in their dashboards. That is where whitelabeldashboard comes in. We offer a secure environment for you and your customers, where they can view the dashboards that are relevant for them.</p>
